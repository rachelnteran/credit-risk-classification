## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. 

* Explain the purpose of the analysis.
This analysis is meant to help lenders assess the credit worthiness of potential borrowers.
* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
This data includes historical lending data from peer to peer lending including risk factors such as debt to income, interest rates, loan sizes, number of accounts, deragatory marks, total debt and loan status.
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
This analysis is used the risk factors listed abovea to predict credit worthiness in binary terms as a credit risk or a healthy loan
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
Begin this process by isolating the features and the target variables. Then use the train_test_split from sklearn to split out training and testing date. Create an instance of the model and train the it using the training data. Use that model to predict outcomes for your target varaible 
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any other algorithms).
The methos used in this analysis include LogisticRegression 


## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
    * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
    * Accuracy is very high for the logistic regression model 
    * the precision score is 1 which indicates high level of precision for the healthy loan. The precision score for credit risks is .84 which is still a very high level of precision. High precision indicates a high ratio of true positives 
    * the recall score is very close to 1 meaning that there are few false negatives

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
the linear regression model performs best for predicting 0s (healthy loans) based on the higher precision and recall score. 
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )
For a lending business correctly identifying low risk borrowers is important to maintain a healthy customer base. For marketing it is more useful to know who you identify as a good lendee than those who are credit risks .

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
